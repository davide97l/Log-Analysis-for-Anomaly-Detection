# Log-Analysis-for-Anomaly-Detection
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anomaly detection plays an important role in management of modern large-scale distributed systems. Logs are widely used for anomaly detection, recording system runtime information and errors. Traditionally, operators have to go through the logs manually with keyword searching and rule matching. The increasing scale and complexity of modern systems, however, makes the volume of logs explode, which renders the infeasibility of manual inspection. To reduce manual eﬀort, we need anomaly detection methods based on automated log analysis.<br>Raw log messages are usually unstructured texts. To enable automated mining of unstructured logs, the ﬁrst step is to perform log parsing, whereby unstructured raw log messages can be transformed into a sequence of structured events. Then we are able to do anomaly detection based on these sequences.</p>

<p>The process of log analysis for anomaly detection involves four main steps: <strong>log collection</strong>, <strong>log parsing</strong>, <strong>feature extraction</strong>, and <strong>anomaly detection</strong>.  </p>
