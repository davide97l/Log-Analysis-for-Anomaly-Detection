# Log-Analysis-for-Anomaly-Detection

The process of log analysis for anomaly detection involves four main steps: <strong>log collection</strong>, <strong>log parsing</strong>, <strong>feature extraction</strong>, and <strong>anomaly detection</strong>.  
To run the whole anomaly detection pipeline follow the below steps:  
- create a "log" folder and put the log file in it.
- run "IPLom_parser.py" to parse the log file.
- run "anomaly_detection_benchmark.py" to detect anomalies in the data.
- run "plot_anomaly_detection_charts.py" to plot the charts relative to the metrics of the detection results.
